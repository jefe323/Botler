Botler
======
A C# IRC bot compiled with .NET 4.0 and utilizing the SmartIRC4Net library. This project originally started out as something for me to do while I was bored at work. Several of the IRC channels I frequented at the time used a SkyBot and the owner decided to pull the bot.  I decided to bring up Botler (then called Cadbury) as a full time replacement for those channels.  

I am currently working on the 3.0 version which will feature a full GUI and a plugin system so users can write their own commands and features into the bot. There is no ETA for a released version, but I hope to put out a working version sometime in Spring 2014.

Please let me know if you have any feature requests as now is the best time to implement them
