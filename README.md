Botler
======
A C# IRC bot compiled with .NET 4.0 and utilizing the AccelIRC library. This project originally started out as something for me to do while I was bored at work. Several of the IRC channels I frequented at the time used a SkyBot and the owner decided to pull the bot.  I decided to bring up Botler (then called Cadbury) as a full time replacement for those channels.  

Over the past year or so I've been fiddling around with this program a lot of things have changed.  I am currently working on the "2.0" version of the bot which entails a complete re-write of the core program as well as releasing the source.

If you want to see the bot in it's current state, you can head on over to irc.esper.net:6667 #jefe323.  You can see a full list of commands here: http://www.jefe323.com/Project/Botler.aspx

This README will be updated with all the commands and features once the new version is complete.
