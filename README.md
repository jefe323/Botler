Botler
======
A C# IRC bot compiled with .NET 4.0 and utilizing the SmartIRC4Net library. This project originally started out as something for me to do while I was bored at work. Several of the IRC channels I frequented at the time used a SkyBot and the owner decided to pull the bot.  I decided to bring up Botler (then called Cadbury) as a full time replacement for those channels.  

This is the beginning of version 3 of the bot which will feature a GUI for ease of use and a plugin system that will allow users to write their own commands and will let operators modify plugins at run-time.

There is currently no ETA for a completion of version 3, though I hope to get it done by late Spring 2014.
